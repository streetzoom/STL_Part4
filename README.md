Stack and Queue Challenge
A Palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards or forwards.

Simple examples are: madam bob toot radar

===================================================================

An entire phrase can also be a palindome, for example:

A Toyota's a toyota

A Santa at NASA

A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal-Panama!

===================================================================

For the purposes of this assignment we will only consider alpha characters and omit all other characters.

We will also not be considering case.

So, A Santa at Nasa, will be processed as: ASANTAATNASA

===================================================================

A common method to solve this problem is to compare the string to its reverse and if the are equal then it must be a palindrome. But we will use a Stack and Queue.

So,

is_palindrome("A Santa at Nasa"); will return true

is_palindrome("Hello"); will return false

Please use a deque to solve the problem.
